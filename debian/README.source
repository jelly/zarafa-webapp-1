The upstream source contains some file we don't want because they are not
compatable with the Debian Free Software Guide. In detail there are javascript
files that are minimized, *.swf files and other files we have to filter out.

To get rid of these there is a file debian/create-upstream-tarball.sh that will
create a orig.tar.xz file from a given upstream file. This upstream source has
to be already downloaded. You can use uscan to download the upstream source.
The created *.orig.tar.xz will be placed one folder above the repository. Use
the script like:

  $ debian/create-upstream-tarball.sh /path/to/webapp-VERSION.SVN_ID.tar.gz

The created cleaned *.orig.tar.xz can be used to be imported with
git-buildpackage.

  $ gbp import-orig --sign-tags [--verbose] ../zarafa-webapp_VERSION.orig.tar.xz
